## Creating a Virtual Environment

The purpose of creating the virtual environment is to ensure the stability of the software and to prevent any errors that would occur to a person's computer system if any parameters are subject to change in the code. It is beneficial to do this for testing purposes so that when the final product launches, it can be moved to the official system with the proper configurations made.
